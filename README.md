# 8-week-SQL-challenge

As of now, I have added the solutions to all the questions 

but I am yet to add:
<br>-the table structure along with the output screenshots
<br>-my approach for the difficult or complex questions
<br>-insights drawn from the case study
<br>-ERD for each case study

Till then, here's the link to the case study --> https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/
